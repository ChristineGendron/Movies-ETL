# Movies-ETL

This repository provides a function that cleans, parses, and merges three sets of data from Wikipedia, MovieLens, and Kaggle, containing information on movies and movie ratings. The finished dataframe, which is imported to PostgreSQL in the end of the function, is consistently formatted and contains no redundant columns. It shows a wide range of information about each movie, as well as a count of each rating that the movie has recieved. This can be used for statistical analysis.
